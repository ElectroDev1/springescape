            It's the season of pumpkins, creepy lights and scares, and even Patchy and Tulip have come to celebrate in their spooky costumes
            with a small update on how Spring Escape is doing by answering some questions you'd probably be asking.

        <h3>
            Where have we been?
        </h3>

        <p class="blog-doc-text">
            It's been almost 4 months since Spring Escape - Deep Down Demo released, and ever since we've kept things pretty quiet, mostly because progress has been
            just as slow. After putting together such a big demo in so little time, we wanted to take some time to rest, and later see what the best way would be to
            allow the game to go forward in terms of long time development (funding, maybe publishing, boring stuff).<br>
            These are especially busy times for both of us on the personal side as well, and we'd like to wait for a more appropriate time to discuss more serious
            things about the game's future. However, it's nothing to stop me (ELE) from doing small additions from time to time.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>What about the actual game?</h3>

        <p class="blog-doc-text">
            In terms of the game itself, progress is going at a slow pace, but new things are being added and sector B is especially starting to come together.<br>
            Some elements of sector B were already made back last year, even a good chunk of the first level! (Which is now undergoing changes as well) Its hubworld
            has also gotten a more finalized layout, and all the mechanics that will be introduced in sector B are in various stages of polish!
            <br>And while not complete, writing wise this sector has shaped into a pretty interesting middle act!
            <br><br>
            I'm also slowly working on ways to improve communication during development, improve backend systems and development tools and continue to show the game around
            as much as I can in these busy days. Just like the flowers of spring, in these times we'll keep being quiet and slow.

        <h3>What to look forward to?</h3>
        
        <p class="blog-doc-text">
            We'll definitely show off more stuff public at a later point in development, we're not staying quiet until release or anything like that. Right now we've
            got a lot of things to prioritize before Spring Escape, but we won't give up this far!
            <br>And who knows what weird idea I may get in the future...
